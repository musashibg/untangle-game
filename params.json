{"name":"Untangle-game","tagline":"Untangle the web by removing all intersections between line segments.","body":"### Welcome to Untangle\r\n\r\nUntangle is a simple and straightforward puzzle game in which the player must untangle a web of vertices and line segments in order to remove all intersections between line segments.\r\n\r\nDrag vertices around the game field with the left mouse button to prevent intersections between line segments.\r\n\r\nIn later levels, it is useful to press and hold the left mouse button over a vertex in order to highlight all vertices connected to it with line segments.\r\n\r\nLevels are randomly generated and potentially unlimited in number, although sooner or later the game field will become too tight or the game performance will deteriorate.\r\n\r\nUntangle was heavily inspired by the Flash game [Uncross the Lines](http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/uncross-the-lines.html). Nevertheless, many new features are planned for the future.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.0 needs to be installed in order to play Untangle.\r\n\r\n### Previous versions\r\n\r\nPrevious revisions of the game's source code can be found in [the old repository on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/untanglegame/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
